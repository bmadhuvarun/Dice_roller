# Dice_roller
**Introduction**
The Dice Roller Web App is a fun and interactive project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to roll multiple virtual dice, generating random results just like rolling real dice. The app displays both numerical values and corresponding dice images for an engaging experience.

**Features**
âœ… Dynamic Dice Rolling: Users can roll multiple dice at once.
âœ… Randomized Results: Uses JavaScript's Math.random() to simulate real dice rolls.
âœ… Visual Representation: Displays images of dice based on the roll results.
âœ… Interactive UI: Simple input field for selecting the number of dice and a button to trigger the roll.

**Technology Stack**
HTML: Provides the structure, including input fields, buttons, and result display areas.
CSS: Enhances the UI with styling, button effects, and layout adjustments.
JavaScript: Handles the logic for rolling dice, generating random numbers, and updating the UI dynamically.
**How It Works**
The user enters the number of dice they want to roll in the input field.
Clicking the "Roll Dice" button triggers the rolldice() function.
JavaScript generates random numbers between 1 and 6 for each die.
The numerical results are displayed on the screen.
Corresponding dice images are shown dynamically.
This project is a great practice for DOM manipulation, event handling, and randomization in JavaScript, making it perfect for beginners and game enthusiasts! ðŸš€
